# Synchronous FIFO: Assertion based Verification

FIFOs or any other memory element require more detailed verification effort before it can synthesized on hardware like FPGAs/ASIC.
Here, I have presented many different assertions that can be utilized to very a synchronous FIFO using SystemVerilog.

I encourage you to go through them and then try to write your own assertions for your design specific FIFO. I have also provided the full design and testbench files.

Remember, there are many ways of capturing an assertion, so don't use my constructs to be the only way of wirting assertions :-)
